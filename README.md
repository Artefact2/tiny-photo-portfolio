Usage
=====

* Copy `in.skel` folder to `in`.

* Alter contents of `in` files to taste.

* Put your `.tif` photos in the `in` directory. For optimal results,
  make sure they have EXIF data (including title, author, and
  copyright).

* Run `make`.

* Upload the `out` folder to your webserver. You're done!

Tips
====

Make sure your webserver sends some kind of caching headers (ETags,
Last-Modified, etc.) for bandwidth efficiency. Also make sure it is
compressing static content.

Make sure your MIME types are properly configured, particularly
`.xhtml` files must be served with the `application/xhtml+xml` content
type.

Dependencies

required on the server that will be hosting the pages.
